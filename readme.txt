The Shintzen
--------------------------------

Shintzen is the game that was developent as a project work in my last student year in
Vaasa University of Applied Sciences. Game is not finished and it not highly polished version, 
but it should work and compile.

To compile the game you need a Slick2D game library. To get it go to http://slick.cokeandcode.com/ 

There is some documentation missing from this zip. But I try to find them and but them to distribution.
